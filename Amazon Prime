Data Visualization – Prime Video Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard to analyze Prime Video’s content library by genre, rating, country, release year, and type.
The project focuses on transforming large datasets into clear, actionable insights using effective visual storytelling.
Looking forward to improving it further and exploring more real-world datasets
