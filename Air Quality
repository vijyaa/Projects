Excited to share my Air Quality Report Dashboard, which provides a comprehensive view of air pollution trends across Indian cities.
* Key Highlights:
Identified Top 3 most polluted cities and least polluted cities using AQI metrics
Visualized average pollutant levels (CO, NO, SO₂, PM2.5)
Tracked AQI trends over multiple years, showing a gradual improvement
City-wise AQI mapping for quick geographical insights
 
 This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling, helping stakeholders easily understand environmental data and make informed decisions.
